1in = 2.54cm = 25.4mm = 72pt = 6pc - it is absolute length, which means it is the same on display, paper and phone.
but there is also relative one.The em and ex units depend on the font and may be different for each element in the document. The em is simply the font size. In an element with a 2in font, 1em thus means 2in. 
Expressing sizes, such as margins and paddings, in em means they are related to the font size, and if the user has a big font (e.g., on a big screen) or a small font (e.g., on a handheld device), the sizes will be in proportion.
The px unit is the magic unit of CSS.
